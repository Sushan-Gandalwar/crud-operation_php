<h1>PHP CRUD Operation with AJAX</h1>
This is a simple PHP application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations using AJAX. The application uses PHP to interact with a MySQL database and jQuery to handle AJAX requests.

Installation
To run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd your_repository
Create a MySQL database and import the php-crud.sql file.
Update the config.php file with your database credentials.
Launch the application: php -S localhost:8000 or use XAMPP, WAMP or MAMP.
Usage
The application provides a simple HTML form that allows you to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. When you submit the form, the data is sent to the server using AJAX, and the database is updated without reloading the page.
